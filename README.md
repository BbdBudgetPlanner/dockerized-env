# Dockerized Environment for frontend and backend
- The fronted folder contains the dockerized environment for the frontend, and the api_and_db folder contains the dockerized environment for the api and the database.
- In order to run the whole application, first follow the instructions in the frontend ReadMe file, and then do the same in the api_and_db ReadMe file.
- You must have docker installed in your local machine, furthremore, to run the api you must have java 21 and maven installed in your local machine
- We will you assume you all have docker installed, and you'll be using wsl since docker desktop is not permitted at BBD
- Furthermore, you need to have java 21 and maven installed in wsl, since we have already went through the java levelup, I will assume you have the expertise for that
